============

Optimized and cross platform SMPTE 2022-1 FEC library in C, Python, Java

Brief description
-----------------

SMPTE 2022-1 is a forward error correction standard for real-time video/audio (RTP) transport over IP networks.

Initial goal of the project was to help VLC and others by implementing a C/C++ RTP / SMPTE 2022-1 FEC streams receiver.

Nowadays I focus on using the newer Java and Python implementations for some Ra&D projects using RTP streams.

Please read generated documentation under Docs/build/html/index.html

Remark
------

The python implementation is now part of `pyutils <https://github.com/davidfischer-ch/pyutils/>`_
